  Got Ideas?
</h1>

I do, and they shall be contained no longer! This is a site filled with notes on ideas I'm trying in electronics, photography, and astrophotography. Probably some other random stuff along the way.

Why? I need to get the stuff down somewhere. Some of it I'll need to refresh my own memory later. Some of it may be useful to other people. Some of it is just for fun.

Want to check it out? I can't promise it won't be boring! Click the icon above [or here](https://ideaup.online/) if you're feeling it.

The site is Gatsby based. There's some really nice code in here. I was born for this ðŸ’©

The nice folks at netlify are hosting my above average site for free. So sweet of them! They're so awesome, they'll even update that icon right down there with the status of my site. All that despite me not doing a single thing for them. The world needs more netlify.
