I do, and I'm putting them out there! This is the source respository for my web site. It is devoted to my pursuits revolving mostly around computers, electronics, cameras and telescopes.

Want to check it out? I can't promise it won't be boring! Click the icon above [or here](https://ideaup.online/) if you want to risk it.

The site is Gatsby based. There's some really nice code in here. I was born for this ðŸ’©

The nice folks at netlify are hosting my above average site for free. So sweet of them! They're so awesome, they'll even update that icon right down there with the status of my site. All that despite me not doing a single thing for them. The world needs more netlify.
